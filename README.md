# Azerbaijani Classical Poems Modernized

This project collects Azerbaijani classical poems from Wikisource, cleans them, and produces a modernized paraphrase for each poem. It also includes analysis tasks covering tokenization, vocabulary growth, BPE, sentence segmentation, and spell-checking.

**Dataset**
- Location: `data_translation/poems_translated.parquet`
- Columns: `author`, `title`, `url`, `text`, `modern_text`
- Notes: `modern_text` is generated by a modernizing prompt; see `datasheet.md` for details and limitations.

**Project Layout**
- `data_gathering/`: Go scraper that pulls poems from Wikisource and writes `poems.parquet`.
- `data_cleaning/`: Cleaning outputs and scripts for removing templates and boilerplate.
- `data_translation/`: Prompt and translation workflow that produces `poems_translated.parquet`.
- `task1/`: Tokenization and token frequency stats.
- `task2/`: Heaps' law estimation.
- `task3/`: BPE training and BPE-tokenized corpus.
- `task4/`: Sentence segmentation analysis.
- `task5/`: Levenshtein-based spell checker evaluation.
- `task_extra/`: Weighted edit distance spell-checking and confusion analysis.
- `datasheet.md`: Dataset datasheet and usage notes.

**Tasks Summary**
- Task 1: Space-based tokenizer and frequency statistics.
- Task 2: Heaps' law fit on the cleaned corpus.
- Task 3: Word-level BPE learning and tokenization.
- Task 4: Poetry-aware sentence segmentation analysis.
- Task 5: Levenshtein spell checker over Azerbaijani vocabulary.
- Task Extra: Weighted edit distance with character confusion matrices.
